Apache Kafka :- 

There are 3 types of Pipelines :- 
a.) Batch Data Pipeline  :- Data needs to be computed in the batches or some kind of historical data.
Eg. Monthly Credit Card Analysis, electricity Bills. 
Frequency/Threshold (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly).
Tools :- Airflow,Hive, Spark , Data Warehouse, Visualization.

b.) Near  Real Time Pipeline :- We process the data in micro batches. Eg. 

Tool: Spark Structured Streaming.

c.) Real Time Pipeline :- As soon as any event happens, the data generated is processed in fraction of seconds. 
Tool:- Database CDC (Change Data Capture). we need to capture the change as soon as data is changed in Database. 
Live Leaderboard. board is updated in real time. Twiteer, Bank Transaction, fraud detection (DE + DS), cricket score board. 

Tool :- Apache Flink


In order to build, real time data pipelines, we need messaging queue kind of frameworks so that data can be holded for some time. 

Apache Kafka + confluent kafka (same) is messaging queue. SQS (Simple Queue Service)(AWS). 

Apache kafka is open source. Not is confluent kafka. 
kafka is created at linkedIn.

eg.  Food Delivery                                            /\      |

 Stores all the messages  --------                                      DWH (Transformed Data)
                            
                            
Apache Flink :- pure real time. it is horizontally scalable. processing  engine like spark.
can take any source like DB, Non-Structural data, stores and processes. 

Kakfa Components :- 
Producer - Application which publishes Data In kafka. 
Consumer - application which consumes from kafka.
Cluster - Kafka is a distributed System.
Broker -  Nodes in Kafka Cluster where actual data gets stored. 

Topic -  small segments or space given with in kafka to store the data. 

Partitions -  Dividing the data in multiple parts inside a topic. each topic will be divided 
into multiple partitions.  in a partition, messages will maintain their arrival sequence based on the 
timestamp.
On topic level, sequencing is not available.

Replicas -  

Offset - 

Commits - 

Consumer group - 

Pallelism in Kafka - 

Back Pressure -
                            
Kafka Model -  pub/sub

Kafka Architecture :- 
it is basically Master - Slave Architecture. 

                [ Leader ]  -> Manage
