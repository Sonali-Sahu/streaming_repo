Apache Kafka :- 

There are 3 types of Pipelines :- 
a.) Batch Data Pipeline  :- Data needs to be computed in the batches or some kind of historical data.
Eg. Monthly Credit Card Analysis, electricity Bills. 
Frequency/Threshold (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly).
Tools :- Airflow,Hive, Spark , Data Warehouse, Visualization.

b.) Near  Real Time Pipeline :- We process the data in micro batches. Eg. 

Tool: Spark Structured Streaming.

c.) Real Time Pipeline :- As soon as any event happens, the data generated is processed in fraction of seconds. 
Tool:- Database CDC (Change Data Capture). we need to capture the change as soon as data is changed in Database. 
Live Leaderboard. board is updated in real time. Twiteer, Bank Transaction, fraud detection (DE + DS), cricket score board. 


In order to build, real time data pipelines, we need messaging queue kind of frameworks so that data can be holded for some time. 

Apache Kafka + confluent kafka (same) is messaging queue. SQS (Simple Queue Service)(AWS). 

Apache kafka is open source. Not is confluent kafka. 
kafka is created at linkedIn.
